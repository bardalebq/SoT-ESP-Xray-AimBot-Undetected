# 🏴‍☠️ Sea of Thieves Cheat — ESP, Aimbot, X-Ray | (2026)

**Sea of Thieves Cheats** refer to a class of third‑party tools designed to interact with Rare's pirate sandbox through external memory reading, DLL injection, and driver‑level manipulation. Unlike traditional shooters, Sea of Thieves cheating revolves around **information warfare and naval superiority** — revealing enemy ships, loot, and players through terrain (ESP), providing laser‑precision cannon and gun aiming (Aimbot), and enabling X‑ray vision to see through ship hulls and islands. Their architecture ranges from external RPM‑based overlays to kernel‑driver injections, aiming to stay undetected by Rare's anti‑cheat system. This analysis examines their architecture, feature implementations, and evasion strategies.

## ⚙️ Core Architecture

### Game Context: Sea of Thieves

Sea of Thieves is a shared‑world pirate adventure game where crews compete for treasure, engage in naval combat, and explore a dynamic open world. Unlike many competitive shooters, Sea of Thieves features **no progression advantages** — all players have equal health, weapons, and ship capabilities. This makes **information advantage** the primary factor in player success. Cheats exploit this by providing perfect awareness of enemy positions, loot locations, and ship states.

### Execution Models

1. **External (RPM/WPM):** Standalone process using `ReadProcessMemory` and `WriteProcessMemory`. No code in game memory → lower detection risk. Used for ESP, radar hacks, and simple modifications.

2. **Internal (DLL Injection):** Injects into the game process for deeper control (e.g., cannon aimbot, damage modification, function hooks). Riskier but enables advanced features.

3. **Kernel Driver (Ring‑0):** Some advanced cheats use kernel‑level drivers to bypass anti‑cheat and read/write game memory without detection.

### Pointer Resolution

- **RPM:** Reads player positions, ship states, loot locations, health, and game state.
- **WPM:** Modifies health, ammo, ship damage, and world coordinates (teleportation).
- **Signature Scanning:** Locates `UWorld`, `GObjects`, and `GNames` dynamically.
- **Offsets:** Cheats rely on offset databases updated with each game patch.

## 🔧 Feature Implementations

### 👁️ ESP (Extra Sensory Perception)

- **Player ESP:** Shows all players through terrain with name, health, distance, and crew affiliation.
- **Ship ESP:** Displays ship type (sloop, brig, galleon), health, crew count, holes, and anchor status.
- **Loot ESP:** Highlights treasure chests, skulls, gems, cargo, reaper chests, and ashen items.
- **World Event ESP:** Shows active events (Fort of the Damned, Ashen Winds, Skeleton Fleet, Megalodon, Kraken, Burning Blade).
- **Mermaid & Rowboat ESP:** Locates all mermaids and rowboats.
- **Storage Crate ESP:** Shows resource crates (cannonballs, wood, food).
- **X‑Ray Vision:** See through ship hulls and terrain — reveals enemy player positions inside ships and behind islands.

### 🎯 Aimbot & Combat

- **Cannon Aimbot:** Calculates trajectory and auto‑adjusts aim to hit enemy ships (accounts for distance, cannonball travel time, and drop).
- **Gun Aimbot (Eye of Reach, Flintlock, Blunderbuss):** Similar to FPS aimbots — finds the nearest enemy, computes aim angles, and overrides view angles.
- **Harpoon Aimbot:** Auto‑aims harpoon at treasure, enemies, or ships.
- **Triggerbot:** Auto‑fires when crosshair is over enemy.
- **No Recoil / No Spread:** Eliminates weapon climb and spread.

### 🌀 Movement & Utility

- **Speed Hack:** Increases swimming and running speed.
- **Waterwalk:** Walk on water.
- **Fly / Noclip:** Free flight through terrain (risky — use on alt accounts).
- **Teleport:** Instantly move to waypoint, ship, or loot.
- **Auto‑Bucket:** Automatically bail water from ship.
- **Auto‑Repair:** Automatically repair ship holes.

### 🛡️ Protection

- **God Mode:** Take zero damage (players, skeletons, sharks, etc.).
- **Infinite Ammo:** Never run out of cannonballs, planks, or food.
- **No Fall Damage:** Jump from any height safely.
- **Auto‑Heal:** Automatically use food when health is low.

## 🛡️ Anti‑Cheat Evasion

### EAC / Xbox Live

Sea of Thieves uses **Easy Anti‑Cheat (EAC)** alongside Xbox Live enforcement. Cheats evade detection through:

- **No Injection (External):** EAC never sees a foreign module in the game process.
- **Manual Mapping (Internal):** Loads DLL without standard `LoadLibrary`, evading hook detection.
- **Signature Scanning:** Dynamic offset resolution prevents breakage after patches.
- **Overlay Hiding:** ESP window uses `WS_EX_TRANSPARENT` and `WS_EX_LAYERED` styles.
- **Kernel Bypass (Optional):** Some cheats use kernel drivers to bypass EAC's user‑mode hooks.
- **Trace Cleaning:** Removes logs, registry entries, and temporary files.

## 🔑 Technical Summary

Sea of Thieves cheats exemplify the effectiveness of information‑based cheating in shared‑world games. By relying on RPM/WPM, signature scanning, and external overlays, they provide a comprehensive feature set — ESP, aimbot (cannon & guns), X‑ray vision, and automation — with relatively low detection risk when used carefully. However, EAC and server‑side heuristics remain significant threats. Users must understand these risks and act responsibly.
